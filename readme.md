# apples723's dotfiles

Probably the most important files on my machine. 

## Notes

Since I wanted to keep everything in one spot (all in .dotfiles folder) I create symlinks for all files in the repo that normally would be in `$HOME`

```bash
$ chmod 755 create_symlinks.sh
$ ./create_symlinks.sh
```
